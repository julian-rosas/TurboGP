# This file contains the core classes from which GP indivuals are built, namely:    #
# nodes, trees, and forests.                                                        #
#
# Trees consist in a list of nodes; nodes can take very different forms; nodes can  #
# be either internal (function) nodes or leaf (terminal) nodes; and within each of  #
# both of these categories, there can be even different classes of nodes, such as   #
# low level nodes, mezzanine level nodes, high level nodes, feature nodes, constant #
# nodes, etc. For a detailed explanation on this taxonomy of GP Nodes, please refer #
# to Rodriguez-Coayahuitl, Morales-Reyes & HJ Escalante, "A Comparison among        #
# Different Levels of Abstraction in Genetic Programming", in IEEE International    #
# Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing ROPEC (2019), Ixtapa, Mexico.  #
#
# Similarly, forests consist in lists of trees. GP Forest are typically used for GP #
# applications where a single scalar output is not enough, e.g. vector regression   #
# multiclass classification, and other more exotic application such as Autoencoders #
# synthesis (Evolving autoencoding structures through genetic programming, Rodriguez-

        There are two main methods used to grow trees described in the literature: full (which grows a tree to the max
        allowed depth), and random (which grows a tree to a random depth). Here we propose variant of random grow we call
        'variable', which is the default method to grow trees and subtrees (for subtree mutation). Variable consists
        in randomly growing a tree such that the deeper the node is in the tree, the higher is the probability of
        taking the form of a terminal node.

        Variable grow method allows to generate populations with a diverse range of tree sizes, without having to
        manually rely on the 50/50 standard method. As such, both full and grow methods, are still not fully implemented;
